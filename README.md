### What is it?
Fragaria is a Cocoa syntax colouring NSTextView. This offshoot is specific to PHP and allows you to live-edit scripts and run them to see the output. This is fully functional and self contained, but the UI is pretty ugly. I use it personally and love it, but perhaps only because it's my own recipe. Your mileage may vary.

### Where did it come from?
Fragaria is the vital pulp of Smultron (now Fraise). It's also the vital pulp of this bastardization. I learned a lot from this project, and you might too.

### How to:
Download the zip or clone the repo locally. Open with Xcode and build the Mac OS X target. I haven't bothered to check build settings to make sure nothing is specific to my environment, so if you have trouble and you can't figure out how to fix it, let me know and I'll try to make the build settings more generic.

The resulting binary has everything you need. Type: echo "hello, world!"; and then click the weird round button that says something like "Eva". The full text is "Evaluate" but I just haven't needed to expand that button since I know what it does. Feel free to fix it.

### You can:
* Compile your own php binary and replace the one I've included.
* Switch to a different language
* Wait till I get home tonight to read the rest of this.

Fragria is implemented as a framework that supports both reference counting and GC.
