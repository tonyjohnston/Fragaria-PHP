### What is it?
Fragaria is a Cocoa syntax colouring NSTextView. This offshoot is specific to PHP and allows you to live-edit scripts and run them to see the output. This is fully functional and self contained, but the UI is pretty ugly. I use it personally and love it, but perhaps only because it's my own recipe. Your mileage may vary.

### Where did it come from?
Fragaria is the vital pulp of Smultron (now Fraise). It's also the vital pulp of this bastardization. I learned a lot from this project, and you might too.

Fragria is implemented as a framework that supports both reference counting and GC.

Thanks to Rui Pacheco for the RC changes.
